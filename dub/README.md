DubMark
=======

Hopefully a useful tool for adding subtitles to a video.

The main idea is to make it much easier to get the timing, translations and groups all able to edit the same projects without crazy email chains, strange file directory exchanges etc.

Uses Angular.js to edit and keep things in sync, next will come a backend after getting some feedback from a sub group.
